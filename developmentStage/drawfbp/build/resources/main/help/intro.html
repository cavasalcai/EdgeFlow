<p>DrawFBP is a picture-drawing tool that
allows multi-level diagrams to
be drawn using a number of different element types, and supports
the technology and methodology known as Flow-Based
Programming (FBP).&nbsp; DrawFBP captures the x-y coordinates of the
processes entered, as well as those of bends in the connecting lines,
while preserving the connectivity of the various objects in the
diagram.&nbsp;&nbsp; DrawFBP supports limited "rubber-banding": as
blocks are dragged, the line segments immediately attached to the
blocks will adjust their length and/or angle as needed. </p>
<p>
DrawFBP also supports "stepwise decomposition" by supporting <span
 style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">subnets</span>
- blocks in the diagram which can be clicked on to expand into lower
level diagrams. &nbsp; An element type called <span
 style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">External Port</span> (Output or Input) 
is used to manage
the connections between a lower-level subnet and the diagram that uses
it.&nbsp; Initially a process in the diagram will be of undefined type, but can be changed to
reference either a Java process or a subnet, by using the "Select Component/Subnet Class" and/or 
the "Link to Subnet Diagram" functions in the popup for that element.</p>
<p>
Since connectivity information is preserved when a DrawFBP diagram is
stored, a JavaFBP, C#FBP or NoFlo network can be generated directly from the diagram.  
In the case of JavaFBP and C#FBP, the generated network can be compiled 
and run without leaving DrawFBP.</p>
<p>
DrawFBP supports the JavaFBP and C#FBP parametrization facility, called <span
 style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">Initial Information Packets</span>
(Initial IPs, or IIPs).  It also supports several element types, apart from Processes, 
IIPs and External Ports: <span
 style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">Files<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">,</span>
</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">Reports</span>, <span
 style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">Legends</span>, <span
 style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">Persons</span>, and <span
 style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">Enclosures</span>, allowing a
more visual style of charting.&nbsp; These block types do not represent
actual FBP processes, and do not generate any code, but help with
visualization. Whichever diagram symbol type is selected at the bottom of the screen,
 in the Block options bar, will be painted on your drawing area where you clicked.  </p>

<p> Since DrawFBP
does not specify the
implementation of the design, i.e. "what" not "how", it can be
used at different levels,&nbsp; e.g. to describe the flow of documents
between departments. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Legends are useful as they do not have borders, so can be used to add comments to a diagram; 
Enclosures can be used to drag parts of the diagram, rather than the whole diagram ("panning"), or to 
carve out a piece of the diagram and convert it to a subnet ("excise"). </p>
<p>
Diagrams are held as <span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">XML</span>
files, so they can easily be exported to other systems or environments.</p>
<p>
The extension of these XML files is <span
 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">.drw</span>.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you save a
diagram without specifying the extension, <span
 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">.drw</span> will be automatically added.<br>
