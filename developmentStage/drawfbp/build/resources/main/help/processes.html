<p>
A block in the diagram can represent either a process running a Java, C# or JavaScript component or a subnet.  Of course a 
subnet can also be regarded as a process, so
subnets in the diagram can be associated with a Java or C# class, as well as with another diagram.</p>
<p>The classes associated with Java processes and subnets may both be located either </p>
<ul><li>in the JavaFBP jar file (class information only), or </li>
<li>in a chosen directory.</li></ul> 

<p>You can associate a block with a component or subnet by using the "Select Component/Subnet Class" or 
the "Link to Subnet Diagram" function in the popup for that element. If the block is 
associated with a subnet,
the boundary will be shown with a double line border, and left
double-clicking on it will bring up the referenced diagram.</p>
<p>You can also clear the associations for a given block by selecting the 
"Clear Associated Component or Diagram" function. </p>

<p>
Right clicking on any process (or clicking on Edit/block-related Actions) brings up a popup menu showing
operations that can be performed on it.&nbsp; These depend to some extent on the chosen language group,
so I will sometimes indicate the relevant language group after the menu item.  Here is the full list:</p>
<ul style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">
 <li>"Edit Process Name"</li>
 <li>"Select Subnet Diagram (.drw)" </li>
<li>"Choose Source Code"</li>
<li>"Display Source Code"</li>

<li>"Toggle Multiplexing"</li>
<li>"Set Multiplexing Factor"</li>
<li>"Clear Multiplexing Factor"</li>

<li>"Choose Component/Subnet Java Class" (greyed out if target language not Java)</li>

<li>"Display Port Info" (greyed out if target language not Java)</li>
<li>"Display Full Java Class Name" (greyed out if target language not Java)</li>
<li>"Clear Associated Diagram and/or Class"</li>
<li>"Toggle Visible/Invisible"</li>
<li>"Delete"</li>
<li>"Exit"</li>
</ul>
<p>A block representing a subnet may have both a diagram and a Java class file associated with it.</p>
<p>Double-clicking on a block which is not a subnet will display the process description and 
its port attributes.</p>
<p>When selecting a class, the file chooser will prompt the user to walk through the class directory for his/her project - 
usually the <span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">bin</span> directory.  It will also present the current JavaFBP jar file 
at the bottom of the list, which can be traversed similarly to regular directories.</p>
<p>"Clear Associated Diagram and/or Class" clears out all subnet diagram and component information for the 
block.</p>
<p>If you only have one mouse button, see the next section (One-button Support) for more on this.
