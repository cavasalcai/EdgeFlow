<p>DrawFBP supports "stepwise decomposition", a term that refers to
starting at the top of a design, sketching it out, and then
progressively filling in each block with lower level processes.&nbsp;
This process may proceed through several levels.<br>
<p>
As described above, if a block on the diagram is associated with
another diagram, it will be displayed with a doubled
border.&nbsp;&nbsp; Double clicking on this block will bring up the
lower level diagram in another tab.&nbsp; The higher level diagram is
retained, and may be accessed via an earlier tab. <br>
<p>
The lower level diagram(s) will usually have "sticky" connections,
shown using the External Port icon.<br>
<p>A subnet can be created either by creating a normal block and associating a subnet with it, using "Select Subnet Diagram",
or by selecting the Subnet button at the bottom of the screen, and clicking somewhere on the screen, 
as you would for a normal block.
