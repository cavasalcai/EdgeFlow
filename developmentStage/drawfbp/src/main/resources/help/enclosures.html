<h1>Enclosures</h1>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"></center>

<p>
When "Enclosure" is selected,&nbsp; a dashed box appears on the screen,
with a shallow rectangle in the middle of the top line.&nbsp;  
Any of the the corners can be dragged in any direction, or the small
rectangle at the top can be dragged, in which case the Enclosure as a  
whole is dragged.</p>
<p>Enclosures are used for a number of diagramming purposes - they do not cause any code
to be generated. </p>
<p>Right-clicking on the small rectangle brings up a popup menu showing
operations that can be performed on it.&nbsp; Currently there are seven:</p>
<ul style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">
<li>"Edit Subnet Label"</li>
<li><i>"Edit Subnet Port Name"</i> (deprecated)</li>
<li><i>"Toggle Substream Sensitivity"</i> (deprecated)</li>
<li>"Excise Subnet" </li>
<li>"Drag Contents" </li>
<li>"Toggle Visible/Invisible" </li>
    <li>"Delete" </li>
</ul>

<br>
<h3 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">Edit Subnet Port Name (deprecated)</h3>
<p>This function can now be performed by editing the External Port block in the appropriate subnet.</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">Toggle Substream Sensitivity (deprecated)</h3>
<p>This function can now be performed by editing the External Port block in the appropriate subnet.</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">Excise Subnet</h3>
<p>This function will 
"excise" those blocks and arrows which are completely enclosed by the Enclosure block, and create a new 
subnet including those blocks and arrows.  Arrows that cross the Enclosure boundary will have External Ports
attached to them, which can be edited to specify the external port names, or to toggle the substream sensitivity indicator.</p>
<p>The user wil be prompted to enter the "external port" names for the new subnet, as well as the .drw file name for the new subnet, 
and a description.</p>
<p>
Arrows crossing the Enclosure boundary in the "source" diagram 
will be attached roughly to the new subnet block - if
the user wishes to change their position, they can be adjusted using the 
arrow "drag" function - either dragging the tail or the head of the arrow as appropriate.</p>
<p>Before doing an Excise, the user should save the diagram being worked on.</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">Drag Contents</h3>
<p>Clicking on this function will allow all blocks and arrows within the enclosure to be moved as a unit (see
Dragging below).
