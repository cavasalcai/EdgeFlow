<h1>Ports</h1>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"></center>
<p>Ports are the points of connection that connect the "inside" world of
the component (the process code) with the "outside" world (the
network).&nbsp; Think of a house at, say, 27 Main Street:&nbsp; the
houseowner may say, "Someone is ringing the front door bell", not,
"Someone is ringing the bell at 27 Main Street."&nbsp;&nbsp;
Conversely, the person ringing the bell is seeing 27 Main Street, not
27 Maple Street.<br>
<p>
All connections between processes (whether simple or composite) will
have two port names - an upstream one and a downstream one.&nbsp; When
one of the blocks being connected is an IIP or an External Port, only
the process end of the connection will have a port name (upstream or
downstream as appropriate).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By definition, an IIP is
always "upstream".<br>
<p>When an arrow is first drawn, the tail end is assigned the name OUT and the head end is IN - unless
these names have already been used for the respective blocks, in which case the user should fill in 
names (of course IN and OUT can be modified as desired).<br>
<p>
Files and Reports usually show connections, but no port names are
required.&nbsp; Legends may or may not have connections. <br>
